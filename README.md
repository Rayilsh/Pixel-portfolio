# Pixel-portfolio
I will now assess this portfolio from my perspective:

1)Image Optimisation:
Overall, the portfolio looks great, but there are some images that could be optimised to load faster.
For example, some images are larger than the required screen resolution, which may slow down the loading time of the portfolio. 
Reducing the size of these images and compressing their size will help to speed up the loading time of the page.

2)Adaptive design: In today's world mobile devices have become more and more popular and many users browse websites on their phones and tablets.
Therefore, portfolios should be optimised to work on different devices and screen resolutions.
In this respect, I can say that it didn't turn out very well, as at the time I didn't know how to do a quality adaptive layout for this portfolio.

3)Quality of the code: The portfolio looks attractive, but you should also pay attention to the quality of the code used to create it. 
If the code is clean and well-structured, it improves the performance of the portfolio and makes it easier to maintain and develop in the future.
This project has good code quality, which is a sign of quality work.
